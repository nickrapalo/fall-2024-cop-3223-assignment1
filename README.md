### Quick Testing Feedback

This repo has a make file attached to it. In essence, a makefile just compiles a bunch of commands together. In conjunction with the python file, this allows you, the developer, to ensure you are meeting the basic requirements for the assignment. 

Command to run: `make -s`
  
#### Disclaimers

Now, many of you will find this assignment as no fun or tedious. I get it. Its the start of the semester and trust me, it will take a while to get through the boring stuff of basic programming and onwards to new functionality. 

The sooner we get over this bridge, the sooner we can make new programs. My goal is between week 6-8 (so midpoint of the semester) is start talking about some FE concepts and mix them in with the assignments.

For those that aren't CS (so IT, CPE, whatever), I ain't hanging you to dry. Within the later weeks, I will start incorporating **advanced** datatypes and provide optional challenging programs.
